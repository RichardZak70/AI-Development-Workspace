# RZ AI Core Standards

This repository centralizes the conventions, templates, and tooling that govern AI-focused initiatives across the organization. Use it as the canonical rulebook for designing, building, and auditing AI projects of any size.

## What Is Inside

- **docs/** – authoritative standards that define how we prompt, structure data, validate schemas, lint, and review projects.
- **templates/** – jump-start files for configs, prompt catalogs, editor settings, and data layouts.
- **scripts/** – lightweight automation to audit existing projects and migrate embedded prompts into managed configs.
- **LICENSE** – usage terms for the entire standard set.

## Getting Started

1. Read `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to understand the baseline folder and artifact requirements.
2. Adopt the prompting and Copilot standards before authoring any new automation or agent flows.
3. Copy the files in `templates/` into new projects, then tailor them while keeping the documented defaults intact.
4. Run `scripts/audit_ai_project.py` periodically to verify compliance and surface drift early.

> Treat this repository as a living artifact. Submit pull requests for any net-new rules, keeping the documentation, templates, and automation in sync.
